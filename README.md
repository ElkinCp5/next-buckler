ðŸ”’ The shield that every Next.js app needs.

## Advanced Role Management

Next-Buckler goes beyond basic role-based access control (RBAC) by providing powerful features for handling complex scenarios:

### Simple and Compound Roles

Define straightforward roles like 'admin,' 'editor,' or create compound roles with unique combinations to suit intricate user hierarchies.

## Motivation

After dealing with repetitive boilerplate code for authentication and authorization in numerous projects, I grew weary of it. That frustration led me to create Next-Buckler, ensuring I never face the same challenges again.

## Philosophy

- Never grapple with authentication code again.
- Eliminate hardcoded redirects; let your state effortlessly handle it.
- Designed for ease of use.

## Features

- No flashy content, just solid functionality.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Completely agnostic and adaptable to various use cases.
